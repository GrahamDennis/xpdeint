We'll eventually need to replace such structures in new version.  
I already found myself wanting to scan log messages, so I copied the above over from xmds.

Release Instructions:
*********************

0. Change version in the following files:
    xpdeint/Preferences.py
    setup.py
    admin/linux_installer.sh
    admin/userdoc-source/installation.rst
    admin/userdoc-source/conf.py.  
    
    ChangeLog is an optional change.

1. Make sure everything works with a clean install.  
    (Check out a clean copy and do tests) 
    "svn checkout https://xmds.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmds/trunk/xpdeint xmds2"

2. Change the "last known good" choices in the linux and mac installers, and check them.

3. Go into the admin directory, and run "./create_release_version.sh".

4. Follow that script's instructions for putting the documentation and tarball on sourceforge

5. Update the mac installer file.

6. Announce!
