We'll eventually need to replace such structures in new version.  
I already found myself wanting to scan log messages, so I copied the above over from xmds.

Release Instructions:
*********************

0. Change version in Preferences.py, ChangeLog is an optional change.

1. Make sure everything works with a clean install.  (Check out a clean copy and do tests)

2. Check out a clean copy.  ("svn checkout https://xmds.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmds/trunk/xpdeint xmds2")

3. "cd admin/userdoc-source", and "make html", and "make latex".
    Then "cd ../documentation/latex" and "make all-pdf".  This makes both kinds of documentation.
    
4. "cd ../../../" and "tar -zcf xmds2.0pre1.tgz xmds2.0pre1" makes the bundle.

5. Put that on sourceforge.

6. Announce!
