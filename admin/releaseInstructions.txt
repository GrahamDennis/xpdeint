We'll eventually need to replace such structures in new version.  
I already found myself wanting to scan log messages, so I copied the above over from xmds.

Release Instructions:
*********************

0. Change version in Preferences.py, setup.py, and conf.py.  ChangeLog is an optional change.

1. Make sure everything works with a clean install.  
    (Check out a clean copy and do tests) 
    "svn checkout https://xmds.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmds/trunk/xpdeint xmds2"

2. At the top level, use "svn export . [path]" to make an unversioned clean copy in directory [path].

3. "cd [path]/admin/userdoc-source", and "make html", and "make latex".
    Then "cd ../documentation/latex" and "make all-pdf".  This makes both kinds of documentation.
    
4. "cd ../../" and "make" to compile the Cheetah code.
    
5. "rm -rf xpdeint/waf_build/" to remove build errors if some users try to remake the templates. 

6. "cd .." and "tar -zcf xmds2.0pre1.tgz [path]" makes the bundle.

7. Put that on sourceforge.

8. Announce!
