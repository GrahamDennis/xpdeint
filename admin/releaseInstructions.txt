We'll eventually need to replace such structures in new version.  
I already found myself wanting to scan log messages, so I copied the above over from xmds.

Release Instructions:
*********************

0. Change version in the following files:
    xpdeint/Preferences.py
    setup.py
    admin/linux_installer.sh
    admin/userdoc-source/installation.rst
    admin/userdoc-source/conf.py.  
    
1. Run the ChangeLog script at the top of this file in the top directory, and
     use the resulting ChangeLog to update admin/userdoc-source/news_content.rst

2. Make sure everything works with a clean install.  
    (Check out a clean copy and do tests) 
    "svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/xmds/code/trunk/xpdeint xmds2"
    (Don't forget to "make", "sudo ./setup.py develop", and compile documentation.)

3. Change the "last known good" choices in the linux and mac installers, and check them.

4. Go into the admin directory, and run "./create_release_version.sh".

5. Follow that script's instructions for putting the documentation and tarball on sourceforge

6. Update the mac installer file.

6. Announce!
