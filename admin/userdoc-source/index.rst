Welcome to XMDS2!
=================

This website provides the documentation for XMDS2 (an all-new version of :ref:`XMDS<XMDSHistory>`), a software package that allows the fast and easy solution of sets of ordinary, partial and stochastic differential equations, using a variety of efficient numerical algorithms.

If you publish work that has involved XMDS2, please cite it as `Comput. Phys. Commun. 184, 201-208 (2013) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.08.016>`_.

Automated installers are available for Linux and Mac OS X, refer to our :ref:`installation instructions<Installation>` for details.
