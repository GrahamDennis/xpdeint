Upgrading From XMDS 1.X
=======================

While **XMDS2** is a complete rewrite of the **XMDS** project, much of the syntax has remained very similar.  That said, your code will have to be rewritten as an XMD2 program.  We recommend that you work through the :ref:`QuickStartTutorial` and perhaps the :ref:`WorkedExamples` sections, and then you should be good to go.

The main news when switching to XMDS2 is the long list of new things you can do.  If it's an initial value problem, XMDS2 has a good chance of being able to solve it.
