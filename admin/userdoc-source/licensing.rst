Note that this is a more permissive license than XMDS 1, which was released under the GPL version 2.

We encourage people to submit patches to us that extend XMDS2's functionality and fix bugs. If you do send us a patch, we do not require copyright assignment, but please include a statement saying you agree to license your code under the BSD 3-clause license.
