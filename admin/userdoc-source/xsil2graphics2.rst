xsil2graphics2
===============

**xsil2graphics2** is a way of converting ".xsil" files to formats that other programs can read.  The syntax is described in the :ref:`QuickStartTutorial`, and by using the ``xsil2graphics2 --help`` option.  It currently can covert any output format for use by Mathematica, MATLAB and Octave.

We recommend HDF5 format instead of the binary format for output and input, as many visualisation tools can already read/write to this format directly.
