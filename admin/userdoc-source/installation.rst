Installation
============

**XMDS2** can be installed on any unix-like system including linux, Tru64, Mac OS X.  

For users, it requires only a working copy of python and C++, but for many purposes a full installation involving several other packages can be very useful.

**FIXME: More details on installation.  Note also that the test suite should be talked about here.**

Currently, this information is found in the README file.

**XMDS2** is written in the template language cheetah.
