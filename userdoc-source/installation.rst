Installation
============

**XMDS2** can be installed on any unix-like system including linux, Tru64, Mac OS X.  

For users, it requires only a working copy of python and C++, but for many purposes a full installation involving several other packages can be very useful.

**FIXME: Some details on installation.  Note also that the test suite should be talked about here.**

For developers, certain other packages are also required.  **XMDS2** is written in the template language cheetah.
