    Cheetah filter for indenting code.
    
    This is oh-so-hackish. I say this because ``trans`` is a transaction
    that is designed to be used when Cheetah is used in WebWare
    servlets. Fortunately for me, a dummy transaction is always
    available that buffers output for every function, so I can just
    ask the transaction for the buffer, and extract the last line to get
    the context for this replacement. If it is pure whitespace, then I
    know that each line of the replacement text (except the first)
    should begin with that whitespace. The first line doesn't need the
    whitespace because it was there before the call.
    
    The result of all this is that if you want auto-indentation, you just
    need to call the filter with the argument ``autoIndent=True``. The following is
    an example of typical usage::
    
        <some whitespace>${someRandomVariableOrFunction, autoIndent=True}@slurp
    
    This way, the whitespace before the variable replacement will be used for each
    line of the replacement text.
    
    The transaction is obtained from the calling frame using Python's introspection
    capabilities. (Go Python!)
    
    Additionally, the option ``extraIndent=n`` can be passed which increases
    the indent by ``n`` spaces.
