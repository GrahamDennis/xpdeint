@def splitNoise($function)
@*doc:
Return the code to generate a new smaller gaussian noise from a previous noise.

The previous noise had a time step of ``old_smallest_step`` a variable available in the C
code, not in the template itself.

  @#
  @set $noiseVector = $parent
  @#
// Split a gaussian noise
  @# Generate a new noise of the appropriate variance
${noiseVector.functions['evaluate'].call(_step = '(_new_step * _old_step)/(_old_step - _new_step)')}

  @# Then add the old noise.
  @# When adding the old noise, the first step is to get a pointer to the old noise itself.
  @# This pointer is called _old_${noiseVector.id}
// Now complete creation of the new noise.

  @# Now do the actual adding. This code creates a loop over the noiseVector
  @# adding the old vector at each point.
