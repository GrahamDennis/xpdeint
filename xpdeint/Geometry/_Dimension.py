  """
  The idea here is that a dimension represents a given coordinate, 'x' say. And this
  coordinate may have a number of numerical 'representations' in terms of a grid. For
  example, the dimension 'x' may be represented by a uniformly spaced grid. The dimension
  could also be represented in terms of a transformed (e.g. fourier-transformed) coordinate
  'kx' that may also be uniformly spaced, but the in-memory layout of this grid will be
  different. Alternatively, 'x' may be represented by a non-uniformly spaced grid. All of these
  details are handled by the `DimensionRepresentation` classes of which a given dimension is
  permitted to have at most two instances at present. One instance should be the 'untransformed'
  dimension, while the other (if present) is the transformed representation of this dimension.
  In this way, different transforms can create the appropriate representations for a given dimension
  instead of hardcoding the assumption that the untransformed dimension is always uniformly spaced
  and the transformed dimension is always uniformly spaced, but the memory layout is split.
  
  This kind of separation is particularly important for things like Hankel transforms which require
  non-uniformly spaced grids, but will also be useful for discrete cosine/sine transforms which have
  a transformed coordinate that is strictly positive.
